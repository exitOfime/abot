Windows 3.11 was released in 1993 as an update to Windows 3.1, which was the first version of Windows to have a graphical user interface (GUI). Windows 3.11 ran on top of MS-DOS, which was the dominant operating system for PCs at the time. MS-DOS was a command-line based system that required users to type commands to perform tasks.
 
To create a Windows 3.11 DOS boot CD, you will need the following:
 
- A blank CD-R or CD-RW disc
- A CD burner and software
- An ISO image of MS-DOS 6.22 and Windows 3.11 install files
- An ISO image of utilities such as Partition Magic, Windows 95 CPU fix, and MS-DOS 6.22 CD driver

You can download the ISO images from the Internet Archive, which is a non-profit organization that preserves digital content for future generations. Here are the links:
 
MS-DOS 6.22 and Windows 3.11 install files: [https://archive.org/details/windows-3.11\_Dos\_6.22\_ISO](https://archive.org/details/windows-3.11_Dos_6.22_ISO) [^1^]
 
Utilities: [https://archive.org/details/CDAIO](https://archive.org/details/CDAIO) [^2^]
 
Once you have downloaded the ISO images, you can burn them to a CD using your preferred software. For example, you can use ImgBurn, which is a free and lightweight program that can create CDs from ISO files. You can download ImgBurn from [https://www.imgburn.com/](https://www.imgburn.com/).
 
After you have burned the CD, you can use it to boot your computer into MS-DOS 6.22 and then install Windows 3.11 from there. You will need to partition and format your hard drive using Partition Magic, which is included in the utilities ISO image. You will also need to apply the Windows 95 CPU fix, which prevents Windows 3.11 from crashing on newer processors. Finally, you will need to load the MS-DOS 6.22 CD driver, which allows you to access the CD-ROM drive from DOS.
 
For detailed instructions on how to perform these steps, you can refer to this guide: [https://archive.org/details/win3\_stock](https://archive.org/details/win3_stock) [^3^], which shows how to install Windows 3.11 on a virtual machine using similar tools.
 
We hope this article has helped you create a Windows 3.11 DOS boot CD and enjoy some retro computing fun!
  
## How to Use Windows 3.11 DOS Boot CD
 
After you have successfully installed Windows 3.11 on your computer using the boot CD, you can start using it for various purposes. Windows 3.11 has a simple and intuitive GUI that lets you launch programs, manage files, and customize settings. You can also access the DOS prompt by typing "exit" in the Program Manager window.
 
Windows 3.11 supports many applications that were popular in the early 1990s, such as Microsoft Office, Paintbrush, Solitaire, and Minesweeper. You can also run some classic games that were designed for Windows 3.11, such as Doom, SimCity, and Wolfenstein 3D. You can find many of these programs online and download them to your computer using a floppy disk or a USB drive.
 
However, Windows 3.11 also has some limitations and drawbacks that you should be aware of. For example, Windows 3.11 does not support multitasking, which means you can only run one program at a time. Windows 3.11 also does not support networking, which means you cannot connect to the internet or share files with other computers. Windows 3.11 also has very low security and stability standards compared to modern operating systems, which means it is vulnerable to viruses and crashes.
 
Therefore, we recommend that you use Windows 3.11 DOS boot CD only for educational or entertainment purposes, and not for any serious or sensitive work. You should also backup your data regularly and scan your computer for viruses using an antivirus program that is compatible with Windows 3.11.
